The objective is to count consecutive candles that share the same color.
For instance, I want to determine HOW MANY TIMES 3 green candles appear consecutively. Let's call this result X.
Next, I want to find out HOW MANY TIMES 4 green candles appear consecutively. Let's call this result Y.
Imagine we have a chart in front of us.
We see 3 GREEN candles and want to know the probability that the next candle will also be GREEN.
This probability is given by Y/X.
Note that in a dataset with a sequence like red->green->green->green->green->red, we only count 1 group of 4 green candles.

GREEN dict: {2: 318, 3: 139, 4: 69, 5: 38, 6: 20, 7: 12, 8: 6}
consecutive 3 / consecutive 2: 0.437
consecutive 4 / consecutive 3: 0.496
consecutive 5 / consecutive 4: 0.551
consecutive 6 / consecutive 5: 0.526
consecutive 7 / consecutive 6: 0.600
consecutive 8 / consecutive 7: 0.500

RED dict: {2: 295, 3: 128, 4: 58, 5: 25, 6: 10, 7: 6, 8: 2}
consecutive 3 / consecutive 2: 0.434
consecutive 4 / consecutive 3: 0.453
consecutive 5 / consecutive 4: 0.431
consecutive 6 / consecutive 5: 0.400
consecutive 7 / consecutive 6: 0.600
consecutive 8 / consecutive 7: 0.333
